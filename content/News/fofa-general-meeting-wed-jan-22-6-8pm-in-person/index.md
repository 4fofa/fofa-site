## Don't Panic - Organize!
Join us for the next Forth on Fourth Ave (FOFA) General Meeting - we will provide 4th Ave updates and plan spring events, like a Greening Day for 4th Ave. It's a great opportunity to "act local" to improve your community.

PS See the new 4th Ave Yarn Collective Yarn Bomb with this sentiment at 4th Ave/3rd street - now up for viewing!
