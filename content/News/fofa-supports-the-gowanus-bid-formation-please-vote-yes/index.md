FOFA Supports the Gowanus BID Formation - Please VOTE YES!
Updated: 
Dec 5, 2024
Voting for the Gowanus Business Improvement District (BID) is underway! A major section of 4th Ave would be included in the new district and FOFA is proud to support and endorse the BID. A BID promises to bring additional resources to the area, specifically, green infrastructure, improved sanitation and maintenance of sidewalks as well as support for small businesses on the corridor and nearby areas.
On November 14, as part of a Gowanus Oversight Task Force Meeting, the BID plan was presented to the general public. A full video recording of the 2 hr meeting is 
HERE
. FOFA co-chair Grace Freedman is a member of the BID formation subcommittee and was part of the evening’s panel to explain and advocate for the new BID. 
More information about the BID is here:

If you are a property owner or tenant within the boundary, please vote 
YES
 on the initiative. In order to be approved by the city, 51% of all property owners and commercial tenants in the proposed area must vote yes on the official ballot. (Votes from residential tenants and other close-by neighbors also count towards "broad support" for the BID). 
The Official Online Ballot is
