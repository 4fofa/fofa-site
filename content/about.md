Forth on Fourth Ave (FOFA) has a 10-year history of successfully lobbying for 4th Avenue improvements (between Atlantic Avenue and the Prospect Expressway) including tree planting, tree bed maintenance (with tree guards), and public art installations. We started as a committee of the Park Slope Civic Council in 2010, and since 2020, have become increasingly involved in the Gowanus Rezoning Plan, which borders 4th Ave. Our current focus is on the 4th Avenue corridor and neighboring side streets, advocating for safer, greener and more resilient streetscape for all to enjoy.
